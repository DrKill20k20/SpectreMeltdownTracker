Centralized database monitoring system vulnerabilities to Spectre and Meltdown attacks. Contribute to enhance security awareness. üõ°Ô∏è

## Vulnerability Tracker

Welcome to the Spectre/Meltdown Vulnerability Tracker repository! This project aims to create a central database to track the vulnerability status of systems regarding Spectre and Meltdown attacks. By collecting information on which systems are still vulnerable, we can raise awareness and facilitate the implementation of necessary security measures.

## How it Works

We provide a script (`vuln_tracker.py`) that gathers information about the vulnerability status of your system. This includes details about installed security patches, processor information, and any other relevant data. The collected information is then contributed to this central repository to create a comprehensive overview.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnavgupta2003/SpectreMeltdownTracker.git
   cd SpectreMeltdownTracker
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script to gather information about your system. (Just need to run Make)
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Contribute:**
   After running the script, follow the instructions to contribute the collected data to this repository. Create a pull request with the generated report.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community to improve the accuracy and coverage of our vulnerability database. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Run the script on your system and follow the instructions to generate a report.
4. Commit the generated report to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request with a descriptive title and details about the changes.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Include information about how to run tests and check code coverage.
- Specify any coding standards or conventions contributors should follow.

Thank you for contributing to the security awareness and improvement of our vulnerability tracker!

## Dependencies

This package is designed to run on Linux and requires the following dependencies:

- `gcc`: GNU Compiler Collection
- `ld`: The GNU linker
- `binutils`: A collection of binary tools
- `sh`: The Bourne Shell (used for running scripts in the terminal)
- `make`: Make is a build automation tool that streamlines software project compilation using a Makefile to define and execute tasks.


## Installation

There are no additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Except for:
- Linux System
- GCC
- LD
- Make

## Installation (Advanced)
For users with custom Linux environments, you may need to manually install additional dependencies. Make sure you have gcc, ld, binutils, and sh available in your system.
